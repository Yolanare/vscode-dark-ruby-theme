# Dark Ruby Theme

A consistent dark theme with a nice red accent color for Visual Studio Code.

This theme is based on the [Community Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-community-material-theme) published by Equinusocio.

---

This theme keeps great contrast between elements while not using pure white or pure black in its color scheme.\
Comments are given a neutral dark-gray color to not be too intrusive.\
Every clickable element gets brighter on hover apart from the "Menu" types of elements that get the accent-color as bg (as shown below).

**Enjoy!**
