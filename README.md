# Dark Ruby Theme

A consistent dark theme with a nice red accent color for Visual Studio Code.

This theme is based on the [Community Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-community-material-theme) published by Equinusocio.

This theme keeps great contrast between elements while not using pure white or pure black in its color scheme.


**Enjoy!**
